# Quickstart: Hyperliquid Execution Adapter

## Plan Gate

1. Confirm branch and base:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git show --no-patch --format='%H %s' HEAD
```

2. Confirm Speckit artifacts:

```bash
SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY=specs/025-hyperliquid-execution-adapter .specify/scripts/bash/setup-tasks.sh --json
```

3. Run relay-Claude adversarial review on the plan before implementation.

## Implementation Gate

Do not write implementation code until the plan review approves and the user explicitly approves implementation.

## MVP Verification Targets

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --lib -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked bolt_v3_provider_binding
cargo test --locked bolt_v3_production_entrypoint
cargo test --locked hyperliquid
```

## No-Submit Proof

The first executable readiness proof must show:

- NT Hyperliquid adapter constructed through provider binding.
- Credentials resolved from SSM only.
- `HYPERLIQUID_*` environment fallback rejected or scrubbed.
- Product matrix discovered and recorded.
- Fee readiness uses official request weights.
- No exchange-mutating request was attempted.

## Live Submit Gate

Live submit remains blocked until a later slice provides a current approval artifact and product-specific proof. Standard perps are the first candidate surface; spot, HIP-3, and HIP-4 stay fail-closed until separately proven.
