# NT Position Sizer Submit Admission Slice

## Scope

This slice wires the Bolt-owned capital reservation ledger into the shared submit-admission gate for one configured prediction-market binary capital pool.

The invariant is asset-agnostic: never admit a submit that would reserve more worst-case liability than the configured capital pool can cover after all live commitments resolve against Bolt.

## Current Enforcement Boundary

Submit admission may enable exactly one capital pool with `enforce_submit_admission = true`.

When enabled, submit admission must:

- reject before NT submit if no fresh NT-derived sizing state exists;
- compose sizing state only inside submit admission from NT-derived components plus the Bolt-owned reservation ledger;
- start with its reservation ledger unreconciled and reject entry reservations until startup/open-order reconciliation succeeds;
- accept an explicit open-order reservation rebuild from live-node NT cache as the only way to open a clean submit sizer;
- keep startup/reconnect admission closed when cache reports open orders that cannot be attributed to known reservations;
- reject duplicate `client_order_id` reservations;
- reject compiled-order evidence that does not match configured venue, account, product kind, or collateral currency;
- reject prediction-market orders whose YES/NO outcome does not match the instrument state;
- reserve liability before NT submit and roll it back if evidence recording or submit handoff fails;
- block on admission-lock contention when rolling back an uncommitted reservation;
- keep submitted reservations live until terminal lifecycle evidence releases them;
- subscribe the live runtime to NT account, portfolio, position, and order events for the configured capital pool;
- publish account/portfolio/product/order-lifecycle components without allowing the feed to inject reservation-ledger evidence;
- seed order-lifecycle count and configured YES/NO inventory from NT cache at startup/reconnect;
- track account-bound submitted/accepted order ids with set semantics so cache snapshots and live events cannot double count;
- keep stale cache snapshots from resurrecting a client order id after terminal evidence;
- release committed reservations on terminal order events so cancel/reject/expire/deny releases committed reservations by client order id;
- release matching account-less NT `OrderDenied` events by client order id, because NT does not attach an account id to that event type;
- track submit-time reservation metadata for orders admitted after process start;
- revalue residual liability from authoritative NT partial-fill events when submit-time metadata exists;
- release reservations and open-order count from authoritative NT full-fill events when submit-time metadata exists.

Only `prediction_market_binary` is implemented in this slice. The compiled order kind is explicit, but only `Limit` exists in the current sizing interface.

## Production Caveat

This slice is not production-grade by itself. It adds the live NT component feed and startup/reconnect cache rebuild boundary, but `enforce_submit_admission = true` is not safe for full production deployment until the remaining liability and operations gaps are closed:

- the configured venue's pinned adapter attests startup reconciliation completeness. At the current
  pin the Polymarket adapter logs and skips venue open orders and positions it cannot represent and
  still returns a successful mass status, so the reconciled NT open-order set can silently omit live
  liability. Bolt reads only that set and cannot detect the omission, and this slice removed the
  independent venue-truth cross-check that previously read venue open orders directly. This is
  machine-enforced: `ProviderBinding::reconciliation_completeness` carries the fact per provider and
  startup validation rejects `enforce_submit_admission = true` while it is `NotAttested`. Closing this
  item means the upstream adapter fails reconciliation instead of skipping, then flipping that provider
  to `AttestedByAdapter`;
- residual liability for rebuilt pre-existing orders is attributable to known Bolt reservation metadata;
- non-empty pre-existing NT/exchange open orders can be rebuilt only when their liability is attributable to known Bolt reservations;
- adapter-produced live collateral spendability and venue/instrument allowance evidence exists beyond the optional configured source binding and NT account free-balance fallback;
- safe replace/amend transitions are implemented before `ReplaceSubmit` is enabled;
- maker quote sets reserve simultaneous adverse fills;
- operator clear-to-Active recovery and flat-position proof are implemented for configured loss halts.

Until those items exist, this code is a submit-admission and live-state-feed slice, not a complete production-grade positional sizer.
